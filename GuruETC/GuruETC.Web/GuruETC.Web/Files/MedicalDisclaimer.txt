The degree of impact indicated in these reports is solely influenced by the answers
            you provided when taking the risk assessment survey. The Risk Assessment Calculators
            on this website do NOT provide a diagnosis or suggest the presence of disease. The
            risk factors and conditions mentioned in the survey do not comprise a complete list
            and therefore cannot be relied upon for diagnosis or treatment decisions. Only a
            licensed health professional can make these diagnostic determinations following
            an appropriate evaluation of your conditions and health situations personally. You
            are advised to consult a physician, dentist or other health professional for complete
            analysis and treatment.
