The results to your health survey are displayed on the left and above. Note that these results do not provide a quantitative or precise measurement as to your health or disease status. Rather, these surveys provide a general and relative indication of the negative impact on health which certain risk factors create. Increasing negative impact should be further evaluated by your dentist.
